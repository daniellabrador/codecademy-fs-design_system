# **Fire and Ice Website Style Guide**

This my personal basic design system for websites. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) has been an invaluable exercise in enhancing my knowledge of CSS colors, typography, the box model, display and positioning.

## Codecademy Project Prompt

In this project, you’ll build a style guide/design system for your website. Developers and designers use design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.

As your websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles will help them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users! It also helps as you start working with other developers, as you can have a consistent reference for how your website should be built.

To complete this project, you should have completed the Codecademy lessons covering the CSS box model, display and positioning, colors, and typography. You can use more advanced CSS layout concepts like flexbox, CSS grid, or responsive design, but they won’t be required. You can take a look at our [basic example site](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/website-design-system/example/index.html) for a taste of what you’ll be building (yours will be customized)."
